# Description
This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end machine learning workflow**, from data preparation and model training to building a **deployment-ready containerized classification model API** to detect the failure of the machine. The API serves predictions from a trained machine learning model and is ready to be deployed to any container orchestration platform.

## **Key Features**
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Covers the data preparation to deployment.
- **Data Preparation**: Explore, preprocess, and engineer features.
- **Model Training**: Train and evaluate multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- **Model Serving**: Build a REST API to serve predictions in real-time.
- **Containerization**: Package the API into a Docker container for easy deployment.
- **Scalability**: Designed to be deployed to any container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS ECS).
