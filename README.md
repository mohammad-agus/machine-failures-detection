# Description
This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end machine learning workflow**, from data preparation and model training to building a **deployment-ready containerized classification model API** to detect the failure of the machine. The API serves predictions from a trained machine learning model and is ready to be deployed to any container orchestration platform.
